    <h2>Ecosystem</h2>
    <p>The planet's sparce ecosystem consists of mainly deserted rocky mountains without any known living lifeforms aside from glowing fungus. This planets is closest to the Sun. They are characterized by their dense, rocky composition with solid surfaces. Planting an Ecosystem on  An experiment for planting on ARTHMINYA designed to evaluate oxygen-producing techniques that could support future human habitats on the Planet. To help sustain expeditionary crews on ARTHMINYA, experiments are underway to utilize the ARTHMINIAN soil plus subterranean ice, as well as the planet’s atmosphere, to make breathable oxygen.</p>

        <h2>Location</h2>
        <p>The planet ARTHMINYA resides in the distant Rytharg solarsystem. Several billion light years away from the milkyway solarsystem.
            when it is closest to the sun, ARTHMINYA is 128.4 million miles from the sun, approximately 1.4 times the distance of Earth. At aphelion, when it is farthest from the sun, ARTHMINYA is 154.9 million miles from the sun, approximately 1.6 times the distance of Earth. Because of its distance from the sun, ARTHMINYA orbits the sun more slowly than Earth. As a result, ARTHMINYA appears to move backward in the sky when viewed from Earth. This is known as retrograde motion. </p>

        <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
        <p>The planets atmosphere consists of mainly carbon dioxide, and its surface temperature lies around  minus 435 Celsius. ARTHMINY is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere less than 1% that of Earth's, and has a crust primarily composed of elements similar to Earth's crust, as well as a core made of iron and nickel. ARTHMINYA  has surface features such as impact craters, valleys, dunes, and polar ice caps. It has two small and irregularly shaped moons</p>
